AURA PCS
#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vm_Gm83O1g <URL HERE>
#### Intro - this is a web application that uses python, css, javascript, html, jinja and SQL to make a website for a made up company which intergrates multiple different features in the website e.g. custom pc builds, a wide range of prebuilds and comparisons ect., aurapcs.shop most of the big text paragrahps are ai but not the code. 
#### I first started with the layout which includes different bootstrap elements and custom css to make a unique layout for my whole application and got ai to generate me a logo for my brand.
#### I then went onto designing the homepage which is why it looks the worst but still good, I used a bootstrap slideshow as the first thing you see along with a custom messgae depending on whether you are logged in. Then linked up the sidebar buttons to the corresponding section of the homepage which allowed for easier travel between sections from a user POV. I used cookies in my app.py to store little bits of data about the user which came in useful for the custom PC section.
#### PreBuild - main, I used adobe photoshop to remove the background from different PCs found online so they would look nice, and then used a bootstrap modal to pop over ( triggered by javasript ) and provide more detals about every prebruild and each one is unique to the others in total there are 12 prebuilds and for each one noted down the spec, description, image, price ect. into a database table name products which stored that so that I could add more in the future with ease. By using jinja in the main prebuilds area it is really easy to add new products making it very expandable. I managed to create a filter using python inside the page that searches for the critirea in the database and displays them below
#### Prebuild - compare - I used jinja to iterate over mini cards of the PCs themselves with the buttons "show" and "hide" show that when you click them they show and hide in the comparison table and you can have as many prebuilds in the table as you want. When you click add to basket on any of the prebuilds it comes up with a toast message that redirects to yout basket as an aknowledgement of adding the prebuild to the basket
#### Prebuild - reccomendations - I made a small questionaire that you fill out that basically filters out PCs for your need and depending on what your answers to the questions are and a list of PCs get produced and then you can visit them - something for next time is that it doesnt always return a result but majority of times it does and would like it so that it always returns a result
#### Prebuild - delivery - it consitst of some information for the supposed customers about deilvery and then has a form the determines whether a postcode is eligible for deilvery. In this case I made it so that all postcodes in england are eligible apart from the isle of wight which is PO. This works through a postcode validator in the app.py which uses an external link to determine whether a postcode is valid and then uses my list of counties to decide if it is eligible. 
#### Custom PCs - the main custom PCs contains information about the service provided and you can get designing which consists of 9 steps each of which contains different parts that are compatible with each other. I have made this able due to a table called stock which is easy to update and maintain and contains all the required information about each part of the pcs which is how I determine whether they are compatible and for the PSU selection, the required wattage is calculated in app.py by adding up the selected parts wattages, as you go through the design process the table updates each time you choose a new part with there name and price each stored in cookies, you then enter a name which helps as an identifier once the custom PC is saved it is then saved into a database but it limits the amount of custom builds a user can save to save storage and to prevent any spamming of custom pcs. Once a custom build has been saved you can then view them through the view-custom-builds.html which provide information on all of the parts they have and is also where you can add the custom build to the basket or delete them allowing the user to make more custom builds. Another section is the compare section which has two selects which the user selects a prebuild and can compare it to a custom build and then generates a summary table comparing the two by using jinja and the python form. 
#### the basket section displays the entire of the users basket and the data is stored in a SQL table basket which holds all the key information requried for checkout, here you can increment the quanitities by one and minus one or delete from basket, this is all made by using python routes and reloading the page each time, something id like to do next time is javascript instead and get better at javasript, anyway once you have confirmed the basket you are redirected to the checkout system via python routes, and you have to first enter you shipping address and a selection of delivery service, this is them submitted through a form via post and then the postcode and county are then validated to ensure user compliability, if not returns the previous page with different erros passed into a render template which is then displayed at the top of the wepbage by using some jinja logic, postcode is again vaidated by the function is_valid_password in app.py which if its good redirect to they payment section in which you enter your billing address which is validated on submition and your billing info, which using javascript is formatted in nice way e.g. the card number is formatted using javascript by making a space every 4 letters, which provides a nicer look and to make it look more professional, all the inputs for the billing information have character length requirements and the form is unable to be submitted unless all the inputs have been filled in, a final display summary table is generated and displays the final cost of the shipping and prodcuts combined. Then once you agree to the required checkboxes, an imaginery order is placed and new data is inserted into an database table named orders, but no actaul payment is required.
#### the login and register system uses hashlib which is a hashing library used for storing passwords more secure and unable to be viewed even by me, the input itself uses javascript to toggle viewing password on which allows the user to view their password when logging in and when they register, they have to confirm their password ensuring that they havent typed soemthing in by mistake, thesee inputs have character length control and the page diplays error messages depending on the error when trying to log in / register. Their informatiom is then inserted into the users table by using sql
#### help center - a part of my application that allows help requests to be sent and/ or feeback to be sent directly to my email by using the smptlib library in python by allowing the user to enter a request into a input and then using thhe library gets send to me.
#### the orders section is where you can view your different orders which is displayed using jinja. All the web icons on the side menu and throughout the application were selected from a website and then throuhg photoshop I changed their colours making them fit into the webiste theme. 
#### this project took me ages.
