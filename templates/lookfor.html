    <ul class="look_for_container" id="factors">
        <h1 class="title">Key Factors</h1>
        <div class="small-hr"></div>
        <li class="look_for">🧠 Performance
        Make sure the PC is powerful enough for what you need it to do — whether that's browsing the web, working, gaming, or creating content. A faster system means smoother performance and less frustration.
        </li>
        <li class="look_for">
        🎮 Graphics & Visuals
        If you’re gaming, editing videos, or using design software, you’ll want a PC that can handle visuals well. Look for strong graphics performance that matches your use.
        </li>
        <li class="look_for">
        💾 Storage & Memory
        Think about how much space you need for files, programs, and games — and how well the PC can multitask. More memory (RAM) helps things run smoother, and fast storage means quicker load times.
        </li>
        <li class="look_for">
        🔌 Connectivity
        Check for the right ports and features. Do you need USB-C? Multiple screens? Wi-Fi and Bluetooth? Make sure the PC has what you’ll actually use.
        </li>
        <li class="look_for">
        ❄️ Cooling & Design
        A good PC needs to stay cool and quiet. Whether you prefer a small, sleek case or a big gaming tower, make sure the design suits your space and won’t overheat.
        </li>
        <li class="look_for">
        🔧 Future-Proofing
        Look for a PC that you can upgrade later if needed. Being able to add more storage, memory, or a better graphics card can save you money down the line.
        </li>
        <li class="look_for">
        💵 Value for Money
        You don’t need the most expensive machine — just one that’s balanced for your needs. Know what matters most to you and spend where it counts.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="medium-hr"></div>
        <ul class="look_for_container" id="parts">
        <h1 class="title">So what do the parts do?</h1>
        <div class="small-hr"></div>

        <li class="look_for">🧠 Processor (CPU)
            The CPU is the brain of the PC.
            It handles all the instructions your computer runs — from opening apps to browsing the web.
            💡 A faster CPU = quicker performance and better multitasking.
        </li>
        <li class="look_for">
            🎮 Graphics Card (GPU)
            The GPU handles images and video.
            It’s especially important for gaming, video editing, and 3D design.
            💡 A strong GPU makes games look better and software run smoother.


        </li>
        <li class="look_for">
        🧮 RAM (Memory)
            RAM is your PC’s short-term memory.
            It temporarily holds the information your computer is using right now.
            💡 More RAM = better multitasking and faster performance with lots of apps open.
        </li>
        <li class="look_for">
        💾 Storage (SSD/HDD)
            This is where all your files, games, apps, and the operating system live.

            SSD = faster, quieter, more reliable

            HDD = more storage for less money
            💡 Faster storage = quicker boot times and loading.
        </li>
        <li class="look_for">
        🧊 Cooling System
        Keeps your PC cool and running efficiently.
        Fans or liquid cooling stop parts from overheating.
        💡 Good cooling = quieter PC and longer lifespan.


        </li>
        <li class="look_for">
        🧰 Motherboard
        The main circuit board that connects everything together.
        All parts plug into it to work as one system.
        💡 Think of it like the PC’s central hub.
        </li>
        <li class="look_for">
            🔌 Power Supply (PSU)
            Converts wall electricity into the right power for each part.
            💡 A good PSU = stable performance and protection from power damage.


        </li>
        <li class="look_for">
            🖥️ Case (Chassis)
            Holds all the components and helps with cooling and airflow.
            It also affects how big your PC is and how it looks.
            💡 Choose a case that fits your space and has good airflow.


        </li>
        <li class="look_for">
            📶 Connectivity (Wi-Fi, Ports, Bluetooth)
            Lets you connect to the internet, plug in accessories, and pair with devices.
            💡 Make sure the PC has the ports you need (USB, HDMI, etc.).
        </li>
